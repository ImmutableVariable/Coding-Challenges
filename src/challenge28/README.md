# Zeckendorf Representation

Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be represented as the sum of 1+ distinct nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers. This representation is called the Zeckendorf representation. Create a function that accepts a integer and returns a list of the Zeckendorf representation of that number.

## Examples

```
64 -> [55, 8, 1]
4 -> [3, 1]
```

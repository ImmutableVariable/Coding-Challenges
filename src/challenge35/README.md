# ASCII Art/PNG Parsing

In this challenge, you will be creating a program that can accept a path to a PNG file, and then convert that PNG file into [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art). The art should be displayed in the console. You decide what the output to the console should look like, but it should still be recognisable to the original image. 

For beginners, you may use a library to parse the PNG file; however, more advanced programmers should try to parse the PNG file themselves.

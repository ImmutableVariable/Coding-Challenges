# Anagram Checker

Create a anagram checker, it should accept two strings and return a boolean if it is a valid anagram. This program should also handle spaces and be case insensitive (capital and lowercase are treated the same).

A anagram is defined as the following:
A phrase that can be formed from rearranging the characters of another string. 

## Examples

```
a , a -> True
b, a -> False
b a, a b -> True
Ba, ba -> True
silent, listen -> True
```

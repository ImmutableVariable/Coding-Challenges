# Find all the Armstrong numbers in a range specified number, 0..N

## Defining:  
A Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of the values of the digits raised to the length of the number.

## Examples: 

```
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153
1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634
0^1 = 0 
individual_digit_of_N^number_of_digits_in_N = N_Is_Armstrong_number
```

So, 153 is a Armstrong number, 1634 is a Armstrong number, and 0 is a Armstrong number.

# Determining the Day of the Week

Given three things, (day, month, year), determine the day of the week. You may assume that the day is always valid, the month is always valid, and the year is always valid. The year is always greater than 1752.

## Example

```
Input
    day: 1
    month: 1
    year: 2020
Output
    Wednesday
```

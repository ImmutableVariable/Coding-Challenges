# End to End Encryption

Build a simple end to end encrypted chat script; you can use existing libraries/implementations for things like encryption. (If you wanna be really easy like me, NaCl is an open standard encryption api implemented in several languages)

At simplest, the solution should take 2 inputs, encrypt them using the sender's private key and the receiver's public key, then decrypt again. You can go a step further if you'd like by implementing a networking backend or support for over 2 users but this is not required!

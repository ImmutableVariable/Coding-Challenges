# Prime Number Factorization

Prime factorization is essential for cryptographic algorithms, and other applications. The goal is to produce a list of the smallest prime numbers that when multiplied produce the original number. For example:
```
84 -> [2, 2, 3, 7]
64 -> [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
83 -> [83] (it is prime)
```

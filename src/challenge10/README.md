# Collatz Conjecture

This is a fairly easy one, most should be able to complete since it is well know. 
It goes like this:
- take a number, 
    - half it if it is even, but 
    - if itâ€™s odd you multiply by three and add one. 
- It should return one at the end. 

Create a program that can calculate the sequence for all n > 0 to 10000 (or 100000 (slo))

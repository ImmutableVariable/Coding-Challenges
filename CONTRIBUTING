# CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please read the following guidelines before submitting a pull request.

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project. Here are a few ideas:

- Add new challenges
- Add new solutions
- Improve existing solutions
- Suggesting New Challenges (BY OPENING AN ISSUE)

## What Not to Contribute

- Solutions that are not your own
- Solutions that are not in the correct format (see below)
- Creating a issue because you can't solve a challenge
- DO NOT submit code golf solutions unless the prompt EXPLICITLY asks for it. Code golfed solutions are NOT beginner friendly and are NOT helpful for most people. They don't teach good programming practices and are often hard to read or understand. They might also be less efficent than other solutions as you prioritize short code over efficency. 
    - Feel free to do it on your own, just dont submit it offically to the repository unless the prompt asks for it.
    - IF the prompt asks for it, you MUST provide a non golfed solution with comments explaining the golfed solution.
    - If you submit a golfed solution without a non golfed solution (TO A PROMPT THAT ASKS FOR IT), it will be rejected.

## First Time Contributors

## General Steps to Add a New Challenge

- Fork the repository
- if you want to add a new challenge called "New Challenge", you would create a folder called `challenge{number}`
- Inside the folder, you would create a `README.md` file with the challenge description
    - you will put the challenge name as the title with a # {name (New Challenge)}
    - you will put the challenge description as the first paragraph
    - you will put the example test case/output as a code block
- You would also create an `answers.md` file with the solutions
    - you will put the solutions in this general format
        - \#\# {Language}
        - \`\`\`{language}
        - {code}
        - \`\`\`
- Add the challenge to the `SUMMARY.md` file
- Create a pull request
